# Market
We have a market system, and at first glance, it can be quite intimidating. 

*It was updated in December 2016 and no longer so no more mucking about with glass panes!*

## Accessing the Market:
Run the command `/market` in chat.


## Selling on the Market:
You can now create a market listing for the item you are holding using the command:

`/market create [price] [quantity]`

**e.g.: While holding 16 pumpkins, `/market create 16 4` will list 4 pumpkins on the market for $16.**

*If you leave the amount blank, it will list the entire stack of items in your hand for the price you gave.*

**e.g.: While holding 16 pumpkins, `/market create 1` will list 16 pumpkins for $1 on the market.**

# Things you can't sell:
